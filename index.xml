      <description>My name is Tommaso Rescio. I was born and raised in Florence (Italy) not so many years ago.
Iâ€™m currently a research fellow at the Politecnico di Torino. In March 2021 I won a scholarship organized by Consortium GARR, which is in charge of designing and managing a high-performance network infrastructure that delivers advanced services to all Italian universities. I received the scholarship as my master thesis can be considered innovative.</description>
